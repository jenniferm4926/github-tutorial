## Git vs. GitHub
Git is a free software developed to help with version control that runs in the command line   
and It helps you keep control of changes by creating a "snapshot" of the code.  
Git can be compared to taking a picture of your present at the time code and you can add  
a message to show what you have added,modified or delelted.Git also requires no internet  
and works on your local machine.  
  
  You need to have a git in order to have a GitHub account.Github severs as a place in the cloud  
  to save your code. Unlike git it does not track the changes in code but the visual changes made to  
  the files.Github is also open source which means that anyone can send in code suggestions to change git.  
  Github also is useful for people when they want to work together on the same project because it merges  
  the new parts together to create one project with both changes.Github can run on the command line as   
  well but it also has its own website-->  [Github Website](http://github.com)  
  that people log into to work with repositories and the commits they have made which show
  different visual   
  changes.  
    
  Both offer a basic workflow, but Github allows you to work with another person's repository by using forking,  
  cloning, push and pull which will be expalined later on in the tutorial.
