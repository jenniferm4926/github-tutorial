<h2>
<a id="git-vs-github" class="anchor" href="#git-vs-github" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Git vs. GitHub</h2>

<p>Git is a free software developed to help with version control that runs in the command line<br>
and It helps you keep control of changes by creating a "snapshot" of the code like a photographer.<br>
Git can be compared to taking a picture of your present at the time code and you can add<br>
a message to show what you have added,modified or delelted.Git also requires no internet<br>
and works on your local machine.  </p>

<p>You need to have a git in order to have a GitHub account.Github severs as a place in the cloud<br>
  to save your code, like an album where your snaps are put together. Unlike git it does not track the changes in code but the visual changes made to<br>
  the files.Github is also open source which means that anyone can send in code suggestions to change it.<br>
  Github also is useful for people when they want to work together on the same project because it merges<br>
  the new parts together to create one project with both changes.Github can run on the command line as<br>
  well but it also has its own website--&gt;  <a href="http://github.com">Github Website</a><br>
  that people log into to work with repositories and the commits they have made which show
  different visual<br>
  changes.  </p>

<p>Both offer a basic workflow, but Github allows you to work with another person's repository by using forking,<br>
  cloning, push and pull which will be expalined later on in the tutorial.</p>

<a id="initial-setup" class="anchor" href="#initial-setup" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Initial Setup</h2>

<ul>
<li> Open up IDE</li>
<li> Go to settings</li>
<li> Look for SSH Key option, click it<br>

<ul>
<li>Copy SSH code, should start with<br>
<code>ssh-rsa</code><br>
An SSH Key is a long encryption that serves as a way of identification and doesn't require a<br>
password, which makes it safer because it isn't open for people to try to guess your password and<br>
mess with your files.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Go to <a href="Github.com">Github</a> Website<br>
</li>
<li>Click button that says "Sign up" for Github<br>

<ul>
<li>Insert information (e-mail,username,password etc.)<br>
</li>
<li>Confirm account by checking e-mail </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Look at the top right of the screen on Github.</li>
<li>Click on your account picture 

<ul>
<li>Click settings

<ul>
<li>on left their is a drop down menu, click on SSH Keys</li>
<li>add SSH key give the key a title</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Return to your IDE add the lines of code github gives you, SEPERATLY!!</li>
<li>Insert <code>ssh -T git@github.com</code> to that you connected your IDE with your Github

<ul>
<li>You should see <code>Hi &lt;username&gt;! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.</code> </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>After this you should do <code>git config --global user.name "First Last"</code> which will prompt you to do<br>
<code>git config --global user.email email@whatever.org</code><br>
-Doing this allows the changes being added to be put under your name to give you credit for your work</li>
</ul>

<a id="repository-setup" class="anchor" href="#repository-setup" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Repository Setup</h2>

<p>Once you get through the initial setup, to start git you have to <code>cd &lt;directory&gt;</code><br>
This chooses what files are being monitered and included in the snapshot.<br>
You use <code>git init</code> to initialize git. Once Git is initialized the directory becomes a<br>
Repository. To have the repo on Github you have to create a Repo with the same name.<br>
It has to be IDENTICAL or it will not <code>push</code> from your local machine to your remote.<br>
A remote is helpful to have because you can access your code from any computer and <code>pull</code><br>
it down to continue working on it, and then <code>push</code> it back up, saving the changes.<br>
Once you have work in your repo you have to do <code>git add &lt;file name&gt;</code> which brings<br>
your work to the stage. The stage is like the prepping place, it sets up your files for<br>
the 'picture'. Once that's done you can go ahead and do <code>git commit -m "msg of what you did present tense"</code><br>
and after this you type <code>git push</code> if you set a <code>orgin master</code> if you haven't then, typing </p>

<pre><code>git remote add origin git@github.com
git push -u origin master
</code></pre>

<h2>
<a id="workflow--commands" class="anchor" href="#workflow--commands" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Workflow &amp; Commands</h2>

<p><code>git add</code> is constantly used after changes are made to files and files have to be sent again to the stage
where <code>git commit</code> takes another picture that shows the changes.
<code>git status</code> helps you monitor what files have been renamed,deleted or modified.
A sample would be </p>

<pre><code>Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
  (use "git push" to publish your local commits)

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)
</code></pre>

<p>Once you <code>comit</code> changes you can 
<code>git push</code> and you can do <code>git status</code> inbetween to see the changes. It's an ongoing that doesnt<br>
have a real order but the options are , add/modify/delete, <code>git add</code>, <code>git status</code>, <code>git commit</code>, <code>git push</code> and in some<br>
cases when collaborating `git pull. </p>
